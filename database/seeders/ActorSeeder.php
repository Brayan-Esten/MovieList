                Blunt attended Ibstock Place School in Roehampton, southwest London and, at age 16, went to Hurtwood House near Dorking, 
                Surrey, a private sixth form college known for its performing arts programme. There, she was discovered and signed by an agent.

                Prior to turning 12 months old, Simmonds lost her hearing due to a medication overdose. Her mother learned American Sign Language and 
                taught the family so they could communicate with her. Simmonds said without her family using ASL, 'I wouldn't have a relationship with 
                my own family, I wouldn't have communication.' Simmonds also has a cochlear implant. Simmonds's mother also encouraged her to read books extensively.

                Colin James Farrell was born in the Castleknock suburb of Dublin on 31 May 1976, the son of Rita and Eamon Farrell. 
                His father played football for Shamrock Rovers FC and ran a health food shop. His uncle, Tommy Farrell, also played for Shamrock Rovers. 
                He has an older brother named Eamon Jr. and two sisters named Claudine (who now works as his personal assistant) and Catherine. He was educated at St. 
                Brigid's National School, followed by the exclusive all-boys private school Castleknock College, and then Gormanston College in County Meath. 
                He unsuccessfully auditioned for the boy band Boyzone around this time. He was inspired to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. 
                the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, but dropped out when he 
                was cast as Danny Byrne in the BBC drama Ballykissangel. While travelling in Sydney at the age of 18, Farrell became a suspect in an attempted murder 
                case. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question; his only alibi was a journal kept 
                by his friend, which explained that the two had been taking MDMA on the other side of town that night.

She has Norwegian ancestry and her family has lived in Montana for generations. Her father twice ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate as a Republican Party nominee. In Kalispell, Williams lived with her three paternal half-siblings and her younger sister, Paige. Although she has described her family as "not terribly closely knit", she shared a close bond with her father, who taught her to fish and shoot, and encouraged her to become a keen reader. Williams has recounted fond memories of growing up in the vast landscape of Montana. When she was nine, the family moved to San Diego, California. She has said of the experience, "It was less happy probably by virtue of it being my preteen years, which are perhaps unpleasant wherever you go." She mostly kept to herself and was self-reliant.

Instead, Ahmed organized parties to celebrate cultures which did not conform to the dominant 'elitist, white' and 'black-tie' culture of Oxford. He later studied acting at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.
